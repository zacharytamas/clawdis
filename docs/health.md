# Health Checks (CLI)

Short guide to verify the WhatsApp Web / Baileys stack without guessing.

## Quick checks
- `clawdis status` — local summary: whether creds exist, auth age, session store path + recent sessions.
- `clawdis status --deep` — also probes the running Gateway (WhatsApp connect + Telegram + Discord APIs).
- `clawdis health --json` — asks the running Gateway for a full health snapshot (WS-only; no direct Baileys socket).
- Send `/status` in WhatsApp/WebChat to get a status reply without invoking the agent.
- Logs: tail `/tmp/clawdis/clawdis-*.log` and filter for `web-heartbeat`, `web-reconnect`, `web-auto-reply`, `web-inbound`.

## Deep diagnostics
- Creds on disk: `ls -l ~/.clawdis/credentials/creds.json` (mtime should be recent).
- Session store: `ls -l ~/.clawdis/sessions/sessions.json` (legacy: `~/.clawdis/sessions.json`; path can be overridden in config). Count and recent recipients are surfaced via `status`.
- Relink flow: `clawdis logout && clawdis login --verbose` when status codes 409–515 or `loggedOut` appear in logs. (Note: the QR login flow auto-restarts once for status 515 after pairing.)

## When something fails
- `logged out` or status 409–515 → relink with `clawdis logout` then `clawdis login`.
- Gateway unreachable → start it: `clawdis gateway --port 18789` (use `--force` if the port is busy).
- No inbound messages → confirm linked phone is online and the sender is allowed (`whatsapp.allowFrom`); for group chats, ensure mention rules match (`routing.groupChat`).

## Dedicated "health" command
`clawdis health --json` asks the running Gateway for its health snapshot (no direct Baileys socket from the CLI). It reports linked creds, auth age, Baileys connect result/status code, session-store summary, and a probe duration. It exits non-zero if the Gateway is unreachable or the probe fails/timeouts. Use `--timeout <ms>` to override the 10s default.
