# Clawdbot macOS IPC architecture

**Current model:** there is **no local control socket** and no `clawdbot-mac` CLI. All agent actions go through the Gateway WebSocket and `node.invoke`. UI automation still uses PeekabooBridge.

## Goals
- Single GUI app instance that owns all TCC-facing work (notifications, screen recording, mic, speech, AppleScript).
- A small surface for automation: Gateway + node commands, plus PeekabooBridge for UI automation.
- Predictable permissions: always the same signed bundle ID, launched by launchd, so TCC grants stick.

## How it works
### Gateway + node bridge (current)
- The app runs the Gateway (local mode) and connects to it as a node.
- Agent actions are performed via `node.invoke` (e.g. `system.run`, `system.notify`, `canvas.*`).

### PeekabooBridge (UI automation)
- UI automation uses a separate UNIX socket named `bridge.sock` and the PeekabooBridge JSON protocol.
- Host preference order (client-side): Peekaboo.app → Claude.app → Clawdbot.app → local execution.
- Security: bridge hosts require TeamID `Y5PE65HELJ`; DEBUG-only same-UID escape hatch is guarded by `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_SOCKET_CLIENTS=1` (Peekaboo convention).
- See: [PeekabooBridge usage](/platforms/mac/peekaboo) for details.

### Mach/XPC
- Not required for automation; `node.invoke` + PeekabooBridge cover current needs.

## Operational flows
- Restart/rebuild: `SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Peter Steinberger (2ZAC4GM7GD)" scripts/restart-mac.sh`
  - Kills existing instances
  - Swift build + package
  - Writes/bootstraps/kickstarts the LaunchAgent
- Single instance: app exits early if another instance with the same bundle ID is running.

## Hardening notes
- Prefer requiring a TeamID match for all privileged surfaces.
- PeekabooBridge: `PEEKABOO_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_SOCKET_CLIENTS=1` (DEBUG-only) may allow same-UID callers for local development.
- All communication remains local-only; no network sockets are exposed.
- TCC prompts originate only from the GUI app bundle; keep the signed bundle ID stable across rebuilds.
